# Super-Modular-Discord-Bot

*Kriz_cold's custom all-purpose Typescript ready Discord bot*

This bot is designed to work with self-contained commands and events, automating the process of adding/removing features to the bot. Once set up, it should be as simple as adding a new file to the commands or events folder, and restarting the bot.

#### Using Yundera

> [ ! ] Work in progress - Instructions needed.

#### Self-Hosting (Development)

> [ ! ] To Do - Instructions for production running needed.

1.  **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed (LTS version recommended). Download from <https://nodejs.org/>.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Open a terminal or command prompt in the project's root folder and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create `.env` File:** Make sure you have created the `.env` file with your credentials as described in the "For Hosting" section.
4.  **Run in Development Mode:** Start the bot using nodemon for automatic restarts on code changes:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    *(This uses `ts-node` to run TypeScript directly.)*
5.  **Build and Run (Production-like):** To compile TypeScript and run the JavaScript output:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm run start
    ```

### Project Structure & Flow

*(You can Click on the file paths to navigate directly to the files.)*

1.  **Entry Point:** The bot starts execution with [`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts).
2.  **Initialization:** This file primarily imports and runs [`src/initializers/clientInitializer.ts`](./src/initializers/clientInitializer.ts).
3.  **Client Setup:** `clientInitializer.ts` creates the Discord `Client` instance, dynamically determines required `GatewayIntentBits` by scanning command and event files, registers event handlers, and logs the bot in.
4.  **Event Handling:** The `registerEvents` function in `clientInitializer.ts` scans the [`src/events`](./src/events) directory. For each sub-folder (e.g., `ready`, `interactionCreate`), it registers listeners. The **folder name** dictates the event being listened to (e.g., files in `src/events/messageCreate/` run on the `messageCreate` event). Files within an event folder are executed in alphabetical order.
5.  **Command Registration:** The `ready` event triggers [`src/initializers/registerCommands.ts`](./src/initializers/registerCommands.ts) (ensured by `clientInitializer.ts`). This script scans the [`src/commands`](./src/commands) directory, compares local command definitions with those registered on Discord (globally or on the test guild), and creates, updates, or deletes commands as necessary via the Discord API.
6.  **Command Execution:** When a user uses a command, the `interactionCreate` event fires. [`src/events/interactionCreate/handleCommands.ts`](./src/events/interactionCreate/handleCommands.ts) receives the interaction, finds the corresponding local command object (based on the command name), performs checks (like `devOnly`, `testOnly`, permissions), and executes the command's `callback` function.

### Adding New Commands (Custom Format)

This bot uses a modular system where command logic is self-contained in files within the [`src/commands`](./src/commands) directory (subfolders are for organization only).

1.  **Create File:** Create a new `.ts` file inside a subfolder of `src/commands/` (e.g., `src/commands/utility/myCommand.ts`).
2.  **Define Command Object:** Use the following structure (you can use [`src/commands/misc/ping.ts`](./src/commands/misc/ping.ts) as a template):

    ```typescript
    import { Client, CommandInteraction, GatewayIntentBits } from 'discord.js';

    export = {
      name: 'ping',                  // Required. The name of the command (/ping)
      description: 'Pong!',          // Required. The description of the command
      permissionsRequired: [],       // Recommended. Specific permissions required to use the command
      devOnly: false,                // Optional. If true, only the bot owner can use the command
      testOnly: true,                // Optional. If true, the command will only be available in the test server
      options: [],                   // Optional. Command options (subcommands, choices, etc.)
      requiredIntents: [             // Highly recommended. Intents required for the command to work
        GatewayIntentBits.Guilds, 
        GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent
      ],


      /*
        Your command initialization code here
        This will run when the bot starts
      */

      const message = "Pong!";

      callback: (client, interaction) => {

        /*
          Your command code here
          This will run when the command is called
        */

        const fullMessage = `${message} ${client.ws.ping}ms.`;
        interaction.reply(fullMessage);
      },
    };

    export = pingCommand;
    ```

3.  **Restart Bot:** The command will be automatically registered or updated the next time the bot starts (when `registerCommands.ts` runs).

### Adding New Commands (Raw Format)

> [ ! ] To Do - Implement the logic in `registerCommands.ts` to detect and handle raw command definitions.

* **(Planned):** For advanced use or compatibility, you will be able to define a command by exporting an object that directly matches the [Discord API's Application Command structure](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-structure).
* **(Planned):** These files **must not** export a `callback` function. The registration script will detect the absence of `callback` and treat the exported object as a raw definition.
* **(Planned):** You will still be able to add `testOnly: true` to register the raw command to the test guild. The script will handle prefixing the description if needed.
* **(Planned):** You will need a separate event handler (likely in `src/events/interactionCreate/`) to manually handle interactions for commands registered this way, as they won't have the automatic `callback` execution.

### Adding New Events

> [ ! ] To Do - Provide detailed steps and examples. Explain how the `clientInitializer.ts` registers events based on folder names.

* Create a subfolder inside [`src/events`](./src/events) named after the [Discord.js Client event](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/main/Client:Class#events) you want to listen for (e.g., `messageCreate`, `guildMemberAdd`).
* Create a `.ts` file inside that folder (e.g., `src/events/messageCreate/logMessages.ts`).
* Export a default async function that accepts `client` and the event arguments.

    ```typescript
    import { Client, Message } from 'discord.js';

    export default async (client: Client, message: Message) => {
      // Code to run when the event occurs
      if (message.author.bot) return;
      console.log(`Message from ${message.author.tag}: ${message.content}`);
    };
    ```
* *(Planned: Explain how to handle raw event listeners if that feature is added).*

### Exporting Context

If you need to provide the bot's code context to an AI or for review, you can use the built-in export script:

* **Basic Context (Core files + Root files):**
    ```bash
    npm run exportContext
    ```
* **Full Context (Including all Commands and Events):**
    ```bash
    npm run exportContext --all
    ```
* This will generate a file named `contextExport.txt` in the project's root directory containing the formatted content of the selected project files.
